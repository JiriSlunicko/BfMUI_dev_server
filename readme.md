Bloodfly Mobile User Interface (BfMUI) dev server
=================================================

This serves for local development and testing of BfMUI on a desktop computer.

BfMUI expects to talk to a Bloodfly Control server running on the same LAN.


Getting started
---------------
1. Create `key.txt` with an arbitrary secret key in the same directory as `app.py` or the executable.
2. Launch `app.py` or the executable.
3. Open the URL that shows up in a browser.

If starting the server fails, try changing the port in `config.txt`.
